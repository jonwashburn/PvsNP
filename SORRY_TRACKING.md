## Resolution Priority

### High Priority (Proof-Critical)
1. NoEliminator.lean Line 96,99: Morton encoding impossibility
2. BalancedParity.lean Line 579: Information-theoretic bound
3. AsymptoticAnalysis.lean Line 222: CA construction

### Medium Priority (Supporting Results)
1. ComplexityGlue.lean Lines 381,385,392: Polynomial bounds
2. BalancedParity.lean Lines 410,414: Linear algebra lemmas

### Low Priority (Implementation Details)
1. Remaining placeholder sorries in BalancedParity.lean

## Next Steps
- Resolve high-priority sorries first
- Each resolution should include complete proof with no remaining gaps
- Update this file as sorries are resolved
