# arXiv Submission Guide: P vs NP Scale-Dependent Resolution

## Overview
This guide walks through submitting our formal proof paper to arXiv.org for academic distribution and peer review.

## Step 1: Compile the LaTeX Paper

### Option A: Online LaTeX Compiler (Recommended if local LaTeX not available)
1. Go to [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Upload `PvsNP_Academic_Paper.tex`
4. Compile to PDF
5. Download the PDF

### Option B: Local Compilation (if MacTeX installed)
```bash
cd docs
pdflatex PvsNP_Academic_Paper.tex
pdflatex PvsNP_Academic_Paper.tex  # Run twice for cross-references
```

## Step 2: Prepare arXiv Submission

### Required Files
- `PvsNP_Academic_Paper.tex` (main LaTeX source)
- `PvsNP_Academic_Paper.pdf` (compiled PDF)
- Any additional files if needed

### Submission Category
- **Primary**: `cs.CC` (Computational Complexity)
- **Secondary**: `cs.LO` (Logic in Computer Science) - optional

## Step 3: Submit to arXiv

### Process
1. Go to [arxiv.org/submit](https://arxiv.org/submit)
2. Create account if needed
3. Upload files:
   - Main file: `PvsNP_Academic_Paper.tex`
   - Compiled PDF: `PvsNP_Academic_Paper.pdf`
4. Fill in metadata:
   - **Title**: "Scale-Dependent Resolution of P vs NP: A Formal Proof in Lean 4"
   - **Authors**: Jonathan Washburn
   - **Abstract**: Copy from LaTeX file
   - **Comments**: "Formal proof in Lean 4 with zero sorries. Repository: https://github.com/jonwashburn/PvsNP"
   - **Category**: cs.CC
   - **MSC Class**: 68Q15 (Complexity classes)

### Submission Notes
- Papers are typically processed within 1-2 business days
- You'll receive confirmation email when live
- The paper will get an arXiv ID (e.g., 2024.XXXX.XXXXX)

## Step 4: Post-Submission Actions

### Immediate (Within 24 hours)
1. **Share on Lean Zulip**: https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/
   - Channel: #general
   - Title: "Formal P vs NP proof - seeking technical review"
   - Content: Link to arXiv paper + GitHub repo

2. **Post on Reddit r/lean**: https://www.reddit.com/r/lean/
   - Title: "Scale-dependent P vs NP proof formalized in Lean 4"
   - Content: Brief explanation + links

### Week 1
3. **TCS Stack Exchange**: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/
   - Carefully worded question about the approach
   - Link to arXiv paper

4. **Reddit r/compsci**: https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/
   - Title: "Formal proof showing P vs NP is scale-dependent"
   - Emphasize the reframing aspect

### Expert Outreach
5. **Email complexity theorists**:
   - Scott Aaronson (UT Austin)
   - Boaz Barak (Harvard)
   - Ryan Williams (MIT)
   - Lance Fortnow (Georgia Tech)

## Step 5: Monitor Reception

### Track Metrics
- arXiv download count
- GitHub stars/forks
- Reddit upvotes and comments
- Academic citations (Google Scholar)

### Respond to Feedback
- Engage constructively with technical critiques
- Update repository based on feedback
- Consider follow-up papers if needed

## Repository Links
- **Main Repository**: https://github.com/jonwashburn/PvsNP
- **Academic Paper**: `docs/PvsNP_Academic_Paper.tex`
- **Lean Source**: `Src/PvsNP/MainTheorem.lean`

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Compile and submit to arXiv
- **Day 2-3**: Share with Lean community
- **Week 1**: Broader academic engagement
- **Week 2-4**: Expert outreach and follow-up

## Success Metrics
- arXiv paper accepted and published
- Positive technical feedback from Lean community
- Engagement from complexity theory experts
- Independent verification attempts
- Academic citations or references
