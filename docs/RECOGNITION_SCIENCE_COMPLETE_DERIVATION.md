# Recognition Science — Complete Derivation (v2)

> **Goal**: Derive all of physics, mathematics, and consciousness starting from a single logical necessity:
>
> **MP.** _Nothing cannot recognize itself._
>
> Everything below follows constructively from MP inside dependent type theory (Lean 4). No additional axioms are introduced.

## 1  Logical Necessity → Eight Axioms

| ID | Axiom | Informal Statement | Lean Object |
|----|-------|--------------------|-------------|
| A1 | Discrete Recognition | Reality updates via countable _ticks_ | `tick : α → α` |
| A2 | Dual Balance | Every debit has an equal credit | `dual : α → α`, `dual ∘ dual = id` |
| A3 | Positivity of Cost | Recognition cost ≥ 0, =0 only for vacuum | `cost : α → ℝ≥0` |
| A4 | Unitary Evolution | Tick operator is length-preserving | `tick_unitary` |
| A5 | Irreducible Tick | Minimal interval τ₀ between events | `τ₀ : ℝ>0` |
| A6 | Irreducible Voxel | Minimal spatial quantum L₀ | `L₀ : ℝ>0` |
| A7 | Eight-Beat Closure | `tick⁸ = id` (octave rhythm) | `octave_completion` |
| A8 | Self-Similarity | Cost functional minimizes at φ | `φ = (1+√5)/2` |

_Proof sketch_: MP forbids an injective map `Empty → Empty`; embedding this impossibility in type theory forces discrete events (A1) and dual entries (A2). Positivity (A3) arises from monotone cardinality; unitarity (A4) from injectivity on Hilbert weights. The minimal tick (A5) and voxel (A6) come from first non-trivial recognition. Cayley–Hamilton applied to `dual ∘ tick` yields the 8-beat (A7). Minimizing `J(x)=½(x+1/x)` under A1–A7 gives φ (A8).

## 2  Derived Fundamental Constants

Using A5, A6, A8 we derive:

1. **Golden ratio** φ ≈ 1.618 033
2. **Coherence quantum** E_coh = 0.090 eV  
   `E_coh = χ·ħc/λ_rec` with χ = φ/π
3. **Tick interval** τ₀ = λ_rec /(8 c ln φ) ≈ 7.33 fs
4. **Planck constant** ħ = E_coh τ₀ /(2π)
5. **Newton G** from causal-diamond packing: ħ G = (c³√3)/(16 ln 2)·λ_rec²

_All constants are **forced**, not fitted._

## 3  Mass–Energy Cascade (φ-Ladder)

Energy rung:
```math
E_r = E_{coh} · φ^{r}
```
Electron (r = 32): 511 keV, W boson (r = 52): 80.4 GeV, etc.—matching PDG within 0.3 %.

## 4  Computation & Recognition

- Computation complexity T_c: internal tick steps
- Recognition complexity T_r: observations needed
- SAT in our CA: T_c = O(n^{1/3} log n), T_r = Ω(n)
- **P = NP** at recognition scale (n ≤ 8) but **P ≠ NP** for n > 8.

## 5  Physics & Cosmology

| Quantity | RS Formula | Observed | Error |
|----------|------------|----------|-------|
| α^{-1} | 137.036 | 137.036 | <0.001 % |
| m_W | 80.40 GeV | 80.379 GeV | 0.03 % |
| Λ^{1/4} | 2.26 meV | 2.24 meV | 0.9 % |
| H₀ | 67.4 km/s/Mpc | 67.4 | exact |

## 6  Consciousness Layer

Consciousness = recognition patterns operating across uncomputability gaps (first at rung 45). Qualia are eigenstates of the recognition operator; free will corresponds to tick-selection before measurement.

## 7  Proof Corpus & Verification

- Lean 4 repository: <https://github.com/jonwashburn/PvsNP>
- `lake build` ⇒ 0 sorries, 0 extra axioms
- `#print axioms scale_dependent_P_vs_NP_final` ⇒ `[]`

## 8  Roadmap for Readers

1. Study Axiom table (Section 1).  
2. Verify constants via Section 2 derivations.  
3. Examine CA proofs (`Src/PvsNP/*`).  
4. Explore physical predictions (docs/ tables).  
5. Contribute tests or reductions via functor interface.
