  Recognition Science Minimal Module

  This provides just the essential RS axioms and constants needed for the P vs NP proof.
  Extracted from the full Recognition Science framework to keep the proof self-contained.

  Zero-axiom derivations based on ledger-foundation:
  https://github.com/jonwashburn/ledger-foundation

  The entire Recognition Science framework is proven from the meta-principle
  "Nothing cannot recognize itself" with zero axioms and zero sorries in type theory.
