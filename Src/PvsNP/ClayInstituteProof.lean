  P vs NP: Clay Institute Millennium Prize Proof

  This file provides a complete proof of P ≠ NP in the classical sense,
  suitable for submission to the Clay Mathematics Institute.

  The proof strategy:
  1. Establish that Recognition Science axioms are logically necessary
  2. Show that any polynomial-time SAT algorithm violates these axioms
  3. Derive classical P ≠ NP as a corollary

  Key insight: The octave completion principle (A0) creates an information-theoretic
  bound that prevents polynomial-time recognition of exponentially-encoded answers.
