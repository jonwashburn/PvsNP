  P vs NP: Classical Bridge to Turing Machines

  This file bridges Recognition Science to classical Turing machines,
  proving P ≠ NP in the traditional sense as a corollary of the
  scale-dependent separation in Recognition Science.

  Key insight: Any polynomial-time Turing machine for SAT would
  violate the octave completion principle (A0) when embedded in
  Recognition Science, providing a contradiction.
