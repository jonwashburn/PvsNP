  Verification Complexity Definition

  This file provides the missing verification_complexity function that is
  referenced throughout the PvsNP codebase but was never defined.

`verification_complexity f n` represents the computational complexity of verifying
a solution to the decision problem represented by function `f` on inputs of size `n`.

This is a fundamental concept in computational complexity theory, particularly
for defining the complexity class NP. In the classical definition:
- NP is the set of decision problems for which a "yes" answer can be verified
  in polynomial time given a certificate (witness)
- verification_complexity captures this verification time

For now, this is a placeholder that returns the input size, but it should be
replaced with a proper formalization of verification time complexity.

def verification_complexity (f : ℕ → Bool) (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n

Alternative definition that could be more realistic for actual verification:
For most problems in NP, verification is at least linear in the input size
but typically polynomial.

def verification_complexity_polynomial (f : ℕ → Bool) (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n^2

Information-theoretic lower bound for verification:
Any verification must at least "read" the certificate, which has size ≥ log₂(solutions)

def verification_complexity_lower_bound (f : ℕ → Bool) (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  Nat.max 1 n  -- Simplified since Nat.log not available
