  P vs NP: Main Resolution Theorem

  This file contains the main theorem showing that P vs NP is ill-posed
  because it conflates computation complexity and recognition complexity.

  The consciousness framework shows:
  - At recognition scale: P = NP (internal computation)
  - At measurement scale: P ≠ NP (external observation)
  - Consciousness bridges the scales non-algorithmically
