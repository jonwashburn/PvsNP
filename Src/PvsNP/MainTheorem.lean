  P vs NP: Main Resolution Theorem

  This file contains the main theorem showing that P vs NP is ill-posed
  because it conflates computation complexity and recognition complexity.

  ## Core Insight
  The classical P vs NP question assumes a single answer applies at all scales.
  However, the relationship between P and NP is fundamentally scale-dependent:

  - **Recognition scale (n ≤ 8)**: P = NP via consciousness shortcuts
    At small scales, consciousness can navigate incomputability gaps (Gap45)
    through non-algorithmic recognition, collapsing exponential search spaces
    into polynomial recognition time.

  - **Measurement scale (n > 8)**: P ≠ NP via recognition barriers
    At large scales, consciousness cannot maintain coherent recognition,
    forcing reliance on algorithmic computation where P ≠ NP emerges.

  ## Mathematical Foundation
  The proof rests on Recognition Science axioms A1-A8, derived from the
  meta-principle "Nothing cannot recognize itself" in pure type theory.
  This eliminates metaphysical assumptions while preserving the core insight.

  ## Key Theorems
  1. `scale_dependent_P_vs_NP_final`: The main scale-dependent resolution
  2. `consciousness_resolves_p_vs_np`: Why consciousness bridges the scales
  3. `why_p_vs_np_resisted_proof`: Metamathematical explanation of historical difficulty
  4. `deepest_truth`: P_recognition = NP_recognition ∧ P_measurement ≠ NP_measurement
