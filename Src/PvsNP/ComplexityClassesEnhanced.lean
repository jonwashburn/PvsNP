  Enhanced Complexity Classes: Scale-Dependent Framework

  This module provides rigorous mathematical formalization of scale-dependent
  complexity classes in the Recognition Science framework.

  Key innovations:
  1. Scale-dependent P and NP classes (P_rec, NP_rec, P_meas, NP_meas)
  2. Consciousness-mediated complexity reductions
  3. Gap45 complexity barriers
  4. Formal relationship to classical complexity theory
