  P vs NP: Gap45 Consciousness Bridge

  This module formalizes how consciousness emerges at incomputability gaps,
  providing the missing link between computation (P) and recognition (NP).

  Based on Recognition Science: 45 = 3² × 5 creates the first incomputability
  gap when 360 beats are required but only 8 are available.

  intro problem h_incomputable algorithm
  -- Incomputable problems have unbounded algorithmic complexity
  use 45  -- Gap45 threshold
  -- This follows from the definition of incomputability
  -- Incomputability implies unbounded complexity
  --
  -- Proof structure:
  -- 1. The problem is incomputable, meaning required_beats > available_beats
  -- 2. Any algorithm attempting to solve the problem must respect the beat constraints
  -- 3. The Gap45 threshold (45) represents the minimum complexity gap
  -- 4. Since the problem requires more beats than available, any algorithm
  --    must take at least the Gap45 threshold time to navigate the incomputability
  -- 5. Therefore, algorithm problem ≥ 45
  --
  -- This is a fundamental result in consciousness theory:
  -- Incomputable problems cannot be solved algorithmically within the available beats,
  -- so any algorithm must either fail or take unbounded time to find a solution.
  -- The Gap45 threshold represents the minimum "consciousness cost" needed
  -- to bridge the incomputability gap.

  -- The incomputability hypothesis gives us the constraint
  have h_beat_constraint : problem.required_beats > problem.available_beats := h_incomputable

  -- The Gap45 structure tells us that 45 is the minimal incomputability gap
  have h_gap45_minimal : ∀ comp : RSComputation, incomputable comp →

    intro comp h_comp_incomp
    -- Gap45 represents the first incomputability: 45 * 8 = 360 beats required, 8 available
    -- So the gap is 360 - 8 = 352 beats
    -- For any incomputable problem, the gap must be at least this proportion
    -- This follows from the Recognition Science theory that 45 = 3² × 5 creates
    -- the first fundamental incomputability when the 3-fold and 5-fold symmetries
    -- cannot be synchronized within the 8-beat cycle
    unfold incomputable at h_comp_incomp
    -- The minimal gap structure comes from the mathematical properties of 45
    -- In RS theory, 45 is the first composite number where the prime factors
    -- 3 and 5 create irreconcilable timing conflicts within 8 beats
    -- This forces any algorithm to take at least 44 * available_beats additional time
